A style agnostic framework for creative coding using the SuperCollider audio programming language. At its most basic level it will:

* Create a project file structure with configuration, initialisation and cleanup files.
* Create a `buffers` folder from which it collects all sound files and make them available through an intuitive interface.
* Allow for defining quickstart templates for different types of projects using a (very) basic templating engine.
* Allow for the creation and access of modules of sound processes (not available yet).

## Installation

Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/dathinaios/Cactus/releases/latest), unzip & and place the folder in:

    ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/
